#### 英语自我介绍（1 分钟）

Good afternoon, dear professors. I am really glad to be here for this interview. Now, please

allow me to give a brief introduction about myself.

My name is Xie Yu. I'm 26 years old and from Hangzhou, I spent six years in completing my

bachelor degree in Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, because I had studied Communication

Engineering for 3 years, and had finally made up my mind to change my major into English,

which cost me another 3 years. While I was studying subjects of the new major, I gradually

found that I was interested in subjects of liberal arts.

After I took the literature classes, I began to develop an interest in American literature, so

finally I chose to write about Howard Philips Lovecraft, an American horror fiction writer in

the early 20th century for my graduation thesis. Besides, I decided to receive more professional

training in studying the history of British and American literature, expecting that maybe I could

get the opportunity to make some progress or even a breakthrough in the related fields one

day.

Personally, I am easy-going and willing to help others. I’ve served as class monitor, assistant

psychological consultant, and president of an anime club in university. In my spare time, I like

reading books, listening to music and jogging. All in all, I’ve long been admiring the College

of Foreign Languages of Tongji University for its great faculty and hardworking students, and

fascinated by the school motto: to pull together in times of trouble. I sincerely wish that I will

be entitled to an opportunity to study in Tongji University.

Thank you!

#### 哪一年毕的业，工作是做什么，工作内容

I graduated in 2019, after graduation I worked as a foreign trade merchandiser for nearly half

a year.

#### 本科论文是文学类则想 2-3 个老师会问到的问题。

Who is Howard Philips Lovecraft?

1. H. P. Lovecraft was an American writer of weird and horror fiction, who is known for his

creation of what became the Cthulhu Mythos.

2. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England.

3. During the interwar period, he wrote and published stories that focused on his

interpretation of humanity's place in the universe. In his view, humanity was an unimportant

part of an uncaring cosmos that could be swept away at any moment.

4. These stories also included fantastic elements that represented the perceived fragility of

anthropocentrism.

Title of the thesis?

A Study of H. P. Lovecraft’s Works from the Perspective of Baroque Aesthetics

What is baroque aesthetics?

Baroque refers to an aesthetic fashion prevailing in western architecture, sculpture, painting

and literature from late 16th century to 18th century.

Baroque literature reflects the repression and agony in people at that time and their

formalistic aesthetic taste. Pretentious diction, exaggerated and peculiar style and resplendent

form are its characteristics.

What is the main purpose of your graduation thesis.

The major purpose of my thesis is to analyse and find out the elements of Baroque aesthetics

in Lovecraft’s works including the idea, writing style, and aesthetic pursuit.

This thesis is mainly divided into four parts:

the first chapter is about explaining the main characteristics of Baroque aesthetics and Gothic

fiction, because Lovecraft’s stories have also many Gothic qualities, and the elements of these

two styles often appear together in the works.

the second chapter is about the discussion of the Sublimity of Baroque aesthetics and its

representation in his works

the third chapter is about the vacancy of subjects and significance in his stories.

the fourth chapter is about the decadent traits of Baroque aesthetics as well as how Lovecraft presents them.

Gothic fiction?

#### 自我感觉写得如何？应提升之处？

The literary theory used in your thesis?

Because I focused on exploring the qualities of Baroque aesthetics in his works, so I did not

use a certain literary theory in this thesis.

But I used some literary concepts, such the concept of sublimity in the second chapter, which

was first put forward by Longinus in his essay On the Sublime.

According to Longinus, there are five key elements of sublimity:

the capacity of generating great thoughts;

strong and exciting emotion;

appropriate rhetorical configuration;

elegant diction;

and solemn and resplendent structure.




#### 喜欢英国文学还是美国文学，为什么？

I like American literature.

First, from the historical perspective, the United States is a young nation with a short history,

which means that there is not much cultural heritage, but also for this reason it has no

historical burden, so on the whole American literature is optimistic.

There is also a tradition of challenging authority in American literature since Ralph Waldo

Emerson, so when reading the works by American writers I can feel a belief in the future and

an enterprising spirit wishing to create something unique and new.

Second, because America is a nation melted with a variety of immigrants, apart from Anglo

American literature we are able to appreciate the literary works of many other ethnic groups.

These ethnic minorities possess the cultural heritage from their own ancestors and work to

integrate it into the American culture.

As a result, American literature shows a multicultural quality with different values and

philosophies of life under one national background.Lastly, because of the decline of the British Empire and the rise of the United States since the

WWI and WWII, the global power was gradually shifted from the former to the latter.

Consequently, in my opinion,

while contemporary American writers are still paying attention to the fundamental questions

concerning mankind and sticking to a global view,

British writers tend to focus more on the events and social reality within their homeland and

the structural and technical exquisiteness of their works.

Ralph Waldo Emerson?

Transcendentalism?

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American writer and philosopher, he was the most eloquent

spokesman of New England Transcendentalism. To talk about Emerson, it is necessary to

explain his philosophy of Transcendentalism.

1. Transcendentalism is a literary, philosophical and artistic movement that flourished in New

England in the mid-19th century. （是啥，发源地，时间）

2. It originated among a small group of intellectuals who were reacting against the orthodoxy

of Calvinism and the rationalism of the Unitarian Church, developing instead their own faith

centring on the divinity of humanity and the natural world. （起因）

3. Transcendentalism had its roots in European Romanticism, American Puritanism and in

post-Kantian idealism. Its mystical aspects were partly influenced by Indian and Chinese

religious teachings. （思想来源）

4. It has been defined philosophically as the “recognition in man of the capacity of knowing

truth intuitively or of attaining knowledge transcending the reach of the senses.”（哲学定义）

5. Although Transcendentalism was never a rigorously systematic philosophy, it had some

basic tenets that were generally shared by its adherents.

The beliefs that God is immanent in each person and in nature and that individual intuition is

the highest source of knowledge led to an optimistic emphasis on individualism, self-reliance,

rejection of traditional authority. （基础要义）

6. The ideas of transcendentalism were most eloquently expressed by Ralph Waldo Emerson

in such essays as Nature and Self-Reliance and by Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden.

（作品举例）

A writer of ethnic minorities and a work?

James Baldwin. The Fire Next Time.

It’s a collection of two essays.

The first essay is an open letter to his nephew, telling him how African Americans survived the

injustice from generation to generation, and urging him to surpass the inferiority of black

people defined by the white.

The second essay is about Baldwin’s reminiscence of his belief crisis when he was 17 years

old, which was directly caused by the pervasive hypocrisy and corruption he saw in the

Christian Church.African American Literature?

African-American literature is the body of literature produced in the United States by writers

of African descent. （

1、定义）

It begins with the works of such late 18th-century writers as Phillis Wheatley. （

2、起始）

Before the high point of slave narratives, African-American literature was dominated by

autobiographical spiritual narratives. （

3、最早形式）

The genre known as slave narratives in the 19th century were accounts by people who had

generally escaped from slavery, about their journeys to freedom and ways they claimed their

lives. （

4、奴隶叙事）

The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s was a great period of flowering in literature and the

arts, influenced both by writers who came North in the Great Migration and those who were

immigrants from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands. （

5、哈莱姆）

African-American writers have been recognized by the highest awards, including the Nobel

Prize given to Toni Morrison in 1993. （

6、奖项）

Among the themes and issues explored in this literature are the role of African Americans

within the larger American society, African-American culture, racism, slavery, and social

equality. （

7、主题）

African-American writing has tended to incorporate oral forms, such as spirituals, sermons,

gospel music, blues, or rap. （

8、口头形式）

(Harlem Renaissance: The first flowering of African-American literature. It came about during

the 1920s and early 1930s in the Harlem district of New York.

The first important literary movement of African-American writers, it brought the long

neglected African-American literature to the attention of the whole world.

Though short-lived, it produced such outstanding writers as Langston Hughes, Countee

Cullen, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Zora Neale Hurston, Rudolph Fisher, Wallace Thurman,

Arna Bontemps, Eric Waldron, and James W. Johnson.)

#### 最喜欢的一部作品？为什么喜欢？

My favourite work is Flannery O’Connor’s A Good Man is Hard to Find.

O’Connor herself once said that her stories belong to the genre of Catholic realism, because

all her works were intended to admonish people that only Jesus could save their fallen souls.

The central themes of the story are death, original sin, and redemption through violence.

The characterization of this short story is excellent. The two major characters are the

grandmother and the Misfit.

The grandmother was controlling and self-deceptive, intoxicated with complacency because

of her class and race superiority. She tried to maintain the posture that she was a sensible, elegant and cultured lady, but

actually, she was hypocritical, domineering and egoistic.

O’Connor described the Misfit as a killer who looked quiet and spoke unhurriedly, giving a

good first impression to the grandmother.

He had done various rough jobs and experienced many trials and tribulations. Life was very

hard for him,

and it could even be inferred that he had once been a good boy when he said “god never

made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was pure gold.”

Obviously to some degree O’Connor has sympathy for this cruel and merciless killer.

O’Connor’s language is crisp, cold and concise. There is a touch of unusual humour in her

works, which is neither presented through biting sarcasm nor tinged with personal emotion.

It’s a kind of detached dark humour.

Irony is also used in the story. When the grandmother attempted to persuade the Misfit to

pray with her, she said ‘Jesus, Jesus,’ meaning that Jesus will help you, but the frightened voice

with which she said it made it sound like she was cursing.

For me, the most impressive quality of the story is O’Connor ability to integrate perfectly her

own religious concepts and social implications with her talent of writing, which infuses her

works with a sense of mysticism and a sobering power.

What is Catholic realism?

I’ve searched about this term but failed to find a specific explanation, so I tried to explain it

with my own understanding.

I think Flannery O’Connor used the term Catholic realism to emphasize that her stories were

intended to show people what the social reality in the 20th century America really was in a

Catholic’s eyes.

In her eyes, the modern western world is full of crimes and vices while most people are getting

so numb to these evils, so it was her duty to shock and wake them up to see the existence of

God through her grotesque but realistic stories.

Dark humour?

Also known as black humour.

● It is a kind of writing that places grotesque elements side by side with humorous ones in

an attempt to shock the reader, forcing him or her to laugh at the horrifying reality of a

disordered world.

It is humour out of despair and laughter out of tears.

● Black humour conveys anguish and fury at conditions in which institutionalized absurdity

gets the upper hand.

It intends to satirize hypocrisy, materialism, racial prejudice, and above all, the dehumanization of the individual by a modern society.

● Black humour prevails in modern American literature.

Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22 is considered a superb example of the use of black humour.

Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five is also a case in point.

Southern literature?

I try to talk about Southern literature by explaining the term Southern Renaissance.

The Southern Renaissance was the reinvigoration of American Southern literature that began

in the 1920s and 1930s with the appearance of writers such as William Faulkner, Caroline

Gordon, Elizabeth Madox Roberts, Katherine Anne Porter, Allen Tate, Tennessee Williams, and

Robert Penn Warren, among others.

The major themes in their works are: the South’s conservative culture, racial issues and the

burden of history in a place where many people still remembered slavery, reconstruction, and

a devastating military defeat.

These writers also used new modernistic techniques such as stream of consciousness and

complex narrative techniques in their works.

#### 什么是文学？

There are several ways to interpret the concept of literature so far, but none of them alone is

enough to define it. Besides, new answers are still being added to the list of definitions and

interpretations.

First, literature can be regarded as the ‘foregrounding’ of language.

1. This means that the language of literature is carefully organized to attract readers’ attention

to its linguistic structures.

2. In particular, poetry organizes the sound plane of language so as to make it something to

reckon with.

3. Rhyme and unusual word combinations can be seen as examples of such foregrounding.

Second, literature can be seen as the integration of language.

1. Literature is language in which there are various elements and components of text brought

into a complex relation.

2. In literature there are relations of reinforcement or contrast and dissonance between the

structures of different linguistic levels: for example, between sound and meaning, and

between grammatical organization and thematic patterns.

Third, literature can be seen as fiction, as it has a fictional relation to the world.

1. The fictionality of literature separates language from other contexts and leaves the work’s

relation to the world open to interpretation.

2. For example, when the pronoun ‘I’ appears in a poem, it doesn’t necessarily refer to the

poet himself or herself. The narrator can be a fictional person.Fourth, literature can be treated as aesthetic object.

1. With the combination of sensual form and spiritual content, aesthetic objects illustrate the

possibility of bringing together the material and the spiritual.

2. A literary work is an aesthetic object because it engages readers to consider the

interrelation between form and content.

Fifth, literature can be regarded as intertextual or self-reflexive construct.

1. Intertextuality refers to the notion that works are made out of other works: made possible

by prior works which they take up, repeat, challenge, transform.

2. Literature is self-reflexive because it is a practice in which authors attempt to advance or

renew literature and thus is always implicitly a reflection on literature itself.

3. Novels are at some level about novels, about the problems and possibilities of representing

and giving shape or meaning to experience.

Personally, I think literature is the representation of the reality and imagination about life, in

which some elusive truth is contained.

#### 文学的功能？

#### 严肃文学和通俗文学的区别？

● Serious literature deals with profound questions that have universal significance, such as

the fundamental value and meaning of life, and the fate of human beings.

These topics are highly philosophical, so in some works of serious literature the narrator or

the major characters are often obsessed with deep reflection.

● Besides, serious literature organizes its language in a special pattern to make readers

unfamiliar with the expressions, so as to force them to rethink what they used to be very

familiar with to get a renewed aesthetic experience.

This process calls for great patience, so common readers may get bored and give up reading

before they reach the final comprehension.

● On the other hand, popular literature tries to avoid such difficult and ultimate questions

and aims at some brighter, clearer, easier to grasp, more concrete and secular topics, so it is

more practical and closer to daily life.

● Generally speaking, popular literature does not pay much attention to the description of

characters’ inner world, and the pace of plot development is relatively fast, so with its strong

readability, popular literature can well satisfy the need of modern readers.

● But exactly for these reasons, some works of popular literature tend to be vulgar and even

cater for degenerate taste in the commercialized world.

#### 什么是文学理论？

(A term that refers to a set of principles or assumptions upon which our interpretation of a

text is based. Our personal literary theory is our conscious or unconscious development of a mind-set (including values, sense of aesthetics, morals, etc.) concerning our expectations

when reading any type of literature. To articulate this framework and piece together the

various elements of our practical criticism into a coherent, unified body of knowledge is our

literary theory.)

● Consciously or unconsciously, we have developed a mind-set or framework concerning

our expectations when reading a novel, a short story, a poem, or any other type of literature.

（心态或框架）

● In addition, what we choose to value or uphold as good or bad, moral or immoral, or

beautiful or ugly within a given text actually depends on this ever-evolving framework. （判

断取决于框架）

● To articulate this framework and piece together the various elements of our practical

criticism into a coherent, unified body of knowledge is to formulate our literary theory. （理

论形成）

● Literary theory consists of the (conscious or unconscious) assumptions that support our

understanding and interpretation of language, the way we construct meaning and our

understanding of art, culture, aesthetics and ideology. （理论构成）

● Literary criticism concerns our analysis of a certain text, while literary theory concerns our

understanding of some ideas, concepts and intellectual assumptions which are the basis of

the actual literary criticism. （和文学批评区别）

● a well-defined, logical, and clearly articulated theory enables readers to develop a method

by which they can establish principles that enable them to justify, order, and clarify their

own appraisals of a text in a consistent manner. （好理论）

两个文学理论？

New Criticism

New Criticism first appeared in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s.

It emphasized that literary works have the quality of unity or integration.

Different from the historical scholarship practised in universities, the New Criticism treated

poems as aesthetic objects rather than historical documents, and examined the

interrelationships between their verbal features as well as the ensuing complications of

meaning rather than the historical intentions and circumstances of their authors.

For the new critics such as Cleanth Brooks and John Crowe Ransom, the task of criticism was

to interpret individual works of art.

Focusing on the writing techniques and other elements of poetry, the New Criticism tried to

show that each formal element is important to the unified structure.

The enduring legacies of the New Criticism include techniques of close reading and the

assumption that a useful critical activity should help us create richer and more insightful

interpretations of individual works.

But since the 1960s, a number of new theorical discourses appeared and offered more

conceptual frameworks than what the New Criticism did to literary analysis, such as

phenomenology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, Marxism, structuralism, feminism, and

deconstruction.Psychoanalysis

Psychoanalytic theory had an impact on literary studies both as a mode of interpretation and

as a theory about language, identity, and the subject. On the one hand, along with Marxism

it is the most powerful modern hermeneutic: an authoritative meta-language or technical

vocabulary that can be applied to literary works, as to other situations, to understand what is

‘really’ going on. This leads to a criticism alert to psychoanalytic themes and relations. But on

the other hand, the greatest impact of psychoanalysis has come through the work of Jacques

Lacan, a renegade French psychoanalyst who set up his own school outside the analytic

establishment and led what he presented as a return to Freud. Lacan describes the subject as

an effect of language and emphasizes the crucial role in analysis of what Freud called

transference, in which the analysed casts the analyst in the role of authority figure from the

past (‘falling in love with your analyst’). The truth of the patient’s condition, in this account,

emerges not from the analyst’s interpretation of the patient’s discourse but from the way

analyst and patient are caught up in replaying a crucial scenario from the patient’s past. This

reorientation makes psychoanalysis a post-structuralist discipline in which interpretation is a

replaying of a text it does not master.

Deconstruction

● Deconstruction was introduced in America in 1966 by Jacques Derrida's speech at Johns

Hopkins University. (来源)

● As a poststructural approach to literary analysis, deconstruction can be best considered a

"strategic device" for interpreting a text rather than a critical theory, a school of criticism, or a

philosophy. （策略而非论派哲）

According to Derrida, such theories, schools of criticism, and philosophies must identify with

a body of knowledge that they claim to be true or at least to contain truth. （真理）

But the idea that truth or a core of metaphysical ideals can be definitely believed, supported,

and articulated is exactly what Derrida and his deconstruction try to "deconstruct." （解构

真理）

● Considered to be the most intellectually formidable approach to literary analysis,

deconstruction bases its ideas on the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and his assertion

that language is a system based on differences. (for example, we know the difference between

the sounds /b/ and /p/ because we have heard both and can note the difference.) （索绪尔）

Derrida enlarges this concept of difference by declaring that knowing concepts is also a

matter of difference. （扩大不同）

● Denying any "centre" of truth such as God, humanity, or self, deconstruction maintains that

we can never be sure about our values, beliefs, and assumptions. （否认中心）

If this is the case, then we can never be certain about a text's meaning, and we can therefore

never declare that a text has only one meaning. （意义浮动）

The undecidability of a text's meaning is a basic rule of deconstruction. （不决性）Poststructuralism

Poststructuralism is a term applied to a variety of literary theories and practical criticisms

developed after structuralism.

Dating from the late 1960s, poststructuralism is often used synonymously with deconstruction,

although the term is much broader and includes such critical schools of thought as feminism,

psychoanalysis (especially the ideas of Jacques Lacan), Marxism or any of its revisionist forms,

New Historicism, and others.

Theoretically speaking, structuralism posits the objective reality of the text; that is, a

structuralist believes one can examine a text using a standard and objective methodology

and arrive at a conclusion.

Poststructuralists, however, often assert undecidability concerning a text's meaning and

declare that a text may not in and of itself have any objective reality.

Poststructuralists also question the long-held assumptions concerning the processes of

reading and writing and the metaphysics of language.

Postmodernism

This term is generally believed to have appeared as early as in 1930s.

Postmodernists denied the existence of objective reality and ultimate truth, declared the

failure of mondernity because it sought to construct a philosophy upon an external reference

point, such as god, reason and science.

For postmodernists, the only thing left is difference, so everyone can establish his or her own

interpretation of reality.

The core elements of postmodernism can be summarised as:

1. the suspicion and rejection of various grand metanarratives that interpret reality.

2. the always changing concept of ego.

3. the recognition of many subjective interpretations and the denial of objective reality.

4. truth as subjective and relative, which depends on the influence of culture, society and

individuals.

5. The inexistence of the ‘only right’ concept about ultimate reality.

6. The inexistence of the metatheory interpreting the reality and text.

7. No single correct interpretation of the text.

Modernism

Writers and literary theorists of Modernism believed that the text is an objective existence, so

it can be studied and analysed to draw a relevant conclusion. (文本有客观性，所以可以分析

研究得出结论)

The term Modernism refers to the aesthetic movement during 1914 and 1945 that questions

the concepts of British Victorianism and reflects on the physical and psychological catastrophe

brought by the two world wars. （

1914 – 1945，质疑维多利亚主义，反思两战灾难）

Modernist writers began to think about some core beliefs of modernity. （反思现代性）

Writers and artists adopted untraditional stylistic techniques such as stream of consciousness

and started to emphasize subjectivity and how the act of seeing and reading happens rather than the actual object that people see and read. （现代写作技巧：意识流；强调主观性，以

及如何看+读，而非实际客体）

With a transnational characteristic, literary artists blurred the various divisions of existing

genres of literature and refused the preestablished aesthetic theories; （跨国特性，模糊风

格界限，拒绝已有理论）

by borrowing from the psychoanalytical theory of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, they tended

to emphasize the elements of the unconscious and subconscious in the works. （借用精神分

析理论）

Through the process of decentralizing the individual and introducing the concepts of

ambiguity and fragmentation, Modernism began to see life as a collage rather than a map.

（个体去中心化，模糊与碎片化概念，生活看作拼贴画）

Whatever its dating, Modernism is marked, as T. S. Eliot notes, by an "impersonal" view of

humanity and a literature that is distinctly anti-romantic and anti-expressionistic. （人性的非

个人视角，反浪漫反表现主义）

In its ardent search for meaning through form, Modernism typically employs "hard, dry"

language which asserts that feeling or emotions are elicited by the text itself through the

textual arrangement of its images. （通过形式寻找意义）

By rejecting a sheerly personal reading of a work, Modernism declares that a text's meaning

can be found by examining its structure, a technique that is especially true for poetry.

The Modernist Period thus provides literary criticism with a formal explanation for how a

poem or any other work of literature achieves or produces meaning through its form. （新

批评，形式主义化阐释）

#### 什么是文学批评？

According to Matthew Arnold, literary criticism is "a disinterested endeavour to learn and

propagate the best that is known and thought in the world."

It is therefore a disciplined activity that attempts to study, analyse, interpret, and evaluate a

work of art. （规训活动）

This discipline attempts to formulate aesthetic and methodological principles of evaluating a

text. （形成准则）

Through the discerning activity of criticism we can explore the questions that help define our

humanity, evaluate our actions, or simply increase our appreciation and enjoyment of both a

literary work and our fellow human beings. （好处）

Traditionally, literary critics involve themselves in either theoretical or practical criticism.

Theoretical criticism formulates theories, principles, and tenets regarding the nature and value

of art. （形成理论，准则，信条）

By citing general aesthetic and moral principles of art, theoretical criticism provides the

necessary framework for practical criticism. （援引准则来提供框架）

Practical criticism (known also as applied criticism) then applies the theories and principles of

theoretical criticism to a particular work. （应用）It is the practical critic who defines the standards of taste and explains, evaluates, or justifies

a particular piece of literature. （活动）

A further distinction is made between two kinds of practical critics:

the absolutist critic posits that there is only one theory or set of principles being utilized when

evaluating a literary work,

but the relativistic critic employs various and even contradictory theories to evaluate a piece

of literature.

（The basis, however, for either kind of critic, or for any form of criticism, is literary theory.

Without theory, practical criticism could not exist.）

#### 看过新批评的作品吗？(=说出一个批评家)

Cleanth Brooks’ The formalist critics.

In this essay, he lists two objections to the new criticism.

The first objection is that making the work the central concern of criticism seems to detach it

from its author and from his life.

The second is that to emphasize the importance of the work itself seems to sever it from its

actual readers.

Then he points out that speculation on the mental processes of the author will take the critic

away from the work itself, and what such speculation describes is the process of composition,

not the structure of the work composed.

The formalist critic is concerned primarily with the work itself.

To critique the work two assumptions should be put forward:

(1) The relevant part of the author's intention is what he actually put into his work, which

means that the author's intention as realized is the "intention" that counts, not necessarily

what he was consciously trying to do, or what he now remembers he was then trying to do.

(2) An ideal reader is assumed: that is, instead of focusing on the various possible readings,

the formalist critic attempts to find a central reference point from which he can focus on the

structure of the work.

Brooks thinks that the purpose of literary criticism is to tell the reader what the work is and

how its different parts are related rather than a description of the critic’s own emotional state.

Perhaps the critic can do little more than indicate whether in his opinion the work has

succeeded or failed.

He then points out the power and importance of ideas in literature, but also adds that

literature does not simply "exemplify" ideas or "produce" ideas. It does not present ideas simplistically and neatly.

It involves ideas by processing the source material of life.

The literary critic's job is to deal with that involvement.

New Critics believe that the most fundamental purpose of literary criticism is to understand

what a given work really “means”.

#### 有些文学作品价值随着时间下降，你怎么看？

If we focus on the internal qualities of literary works using literary theories such as the New

Criticism, it can be concluded that when a work is finished its value is also fixed and will not

change over time.

But if we posit that the reader plays an active role in the formation of a work’s value, it can be

justified that the values of literary works will change as time passes, because with varying

ideas and concepts in mind readers in different times may judge them quite differently.

Some literary works focus on representing and discussing the specific social problems and

concerns that were generally shared among the contemporaries of their authors, but as time

went by the society was improved and these problems and concerns were either solved or

changed, so the works gradually lost their social significance even if they had once been highly

praised.

For example, most of William Makepeace Thackeray’s works have few readers today except

his masterpiece Vanity Fair.

But in Thackeray's own day some commentators ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his

greatest work, perhaps because it expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as did

some of his other later novels.

It is perhaps for this reason that they have not survived as well as Vanity Fair, which satirises

those values.

#### 假设让你换个方向（翻译、语言学）选哪个？

I have both interest in translation and linguistics, but I will choose translation, especially literary

translation

#### 你对文学翻译的看法？

Literary translation is different from other forms of translation, because the language it uses

is an artistic language with aesthetic functions. （艺术语言美学功能）

This kind of language should be able to help the translator recreate the artistic world and

characters that were first created by the writer with his or her imagination. （再现）literary translation is not simply the transfer of language, but a kind of creative work.

When a literary work that belongs to one culture is transplanted to another cultural

environment, to make the recipient feel the same artistic effect of the original work, the

translator must find in the target language the linguistic means that can arouse the same or

similar association in the recipient’s mind. (移植，找到对应语言手段)

Besides, doing literary translation is also the process of interpreting a brand new cultural and

aesthetic system, as often is the case that a cultural image can be interpreted quite differently

and even oppositely in two cultural systems. （文化审美系统）

Apart from the creative quality of literary translation that is represented by the subjective

effort of the translator in approaching and recreating the original work, the quality of treason

is also important. （叛逆）

Treason means that the translation sometimes deviates from the original text due to the

translator’s intention to achieve certain purposes.

In translation practice, these two qualities are always unified and inseparable from each other,

which is known as creative treason.

The creative treason of literary translation is especially conspicuous in poetic translation.

In poetry form is highly unified with content, so the translator either sacrifices form to maintain

content or vice versa.

Creative Treason: put forward by Robert Escarpit, a French cultural sociologist

阅读过的文学作品中译本，评价它的翻译如何？ (再来个诗集中译本？)

I’ve read Francis Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night translated by Tang Xinmei.

Mr. Tang is a translator who graduated from the History Department of St. John's University

in 1944, so his diction is a little old-fashioned and unfamiliar to contemporary readers.

This translation is said to have been sponsored by U.S. Information Agency, and was first

published in Chinese mainland in 2011.

The translator included in the book a preface explaining the details about how the original

was created and first published in the 20th century America, giving the reader a general

impression of the cultural background.

As to the body of the work, on the whole this translation follows the original faithfully.

By mainly using the strategy of direct translation, the translator well represents the form and

style of the original text, and there is no obvious sign of under-translation or over-translation,

so from the text I could well feel the unique atmosphere of American society in the Jazz Age

as well as the gentle and melancholy tone that foreshadows the tragic ending.But as a result of the foreignization strategy adopted by the translator, some parts of the

book are difficult to understand.

Traces of English syntax can be noticed in a number of sentences, and some similes and

metaphors seem strange because they do not conform with the Chinese pattern of thinking.

In conclusion, I think that though this translation is coherent, still readable, and faithful to the

original, it is somewhat obsolete and should be replaced by newer versions that use more

contemporary expressions.

文学翻译中，对于译者而言，最重要需要做到什么？（译者最重要的素养？）

In literary translation, the most important quality for the translator is his cultural competence.

In essence, literary translation belongs to the category of cultural translation or cultural

communication.

The cultural competence of the translator is best embodied in his understanding of the

cultural differences and literariness of works.

The cultural differences of literary works not only reflect the reality but also help to shape it.

A foreign culture may be alien to us, but it can help change and renew our culture with its

heterogeneity.

For example, ambiguity is a common quality in many literary works, and is deeply involved

with their cultural traditions.

But in literary translation, it becomes an embodiment of heterogeneity and a challenge to the

translator, who must process and transform it into the cultural nourishment to be absorbed

by our culture.

The literariness in literary translation is another challenge to the translator.

Deep thoughts are contained in the story and between the lines of a great work, thus the

literary translator must consider the ideas, concepts and other artistic elements rather than

just focus on the literal meaning.

Among these elements the most important is the literary style of the work, which is related to

both the original writer’s own disposition and the specific culture of a certain period.

The translator’s ability to recognise and recreate the writer’s unique style is critical to the

quality of translation.

翻译中你看重哪些因素？

There are 4 elements to which I attach great importance in translation:

First, the cultural element.

To truly recreate the the original work, the translator should consider not only the differencesof the two languages themselves, but also the two different cultural systems that they belong

to.

The analysis of the cultural differences between the source language and the target language

is a basis of good translation.

In translation, we need to give full consideration to these differences and try to represent the

cultural information and implication of the original work with the expressions conforming with

the cultural conventions of the target language.

Second, the purpose of translation.

to translate is to pass on the information to people using their parent language.

But the specific purpose of translation is affected by the type of the original text.

Scientific translation calls for accuracy, and the main purpose of this kind of translation is to

help the readers understand the usage or principle of a product or technology, so the

scientific translator must evaluate the average knowledge level of the readers about the topic.

But in literary translation to convey the aesthetic qualities the translator must transfer not only

the content but also the form of the work, so elements like writing styles and coherency are

as important as the accuracy of diction. The translator also becomes a writer while translating

a literary work.

Third, the overall competency of the translator.

The translator is the most active element in the translation activity.

All his personal attributes and abilities will affect the quality of translation, because these

factors will be changed into his predisposition toward the text and his problem-solving

capacity in translation.

Fourth, the grammatical structure.

Traces of the syntax of the source language is acceptable as language is always changing and

absorbing the cultural achievements of other civilizations, but when the readability of the

translation is impaired by the excessive use of unconventional syntax, its value will be

significantly reduced.

知道什么翻译理论？文学翻译机器翻译方向的？

The Polysystem Theory was put forward by the Israeli scholar Even-Zohar in 1970s.

Even-Zohar regards the various forms of human communication as a system rather than a

mixture in which different elements are irrelevant to each other.

This polysystem consists of some sub-systems which overlap one another and are

interdependent.

Though these sub-systems function as a whole, their positions in the larger system are not

equal and are constantly changing.

When applied to translation, the theory helps us to better describe the translation activity and understand the nature of translation.

It puts translation under a larger framework of literature, society and culture to examine it,

and introduced Cultural Semiotics to Translation studies.

Usually translated literature is at a marginal position of the polysystem of a country or nation.

But it will come from the margin to the centre when it is widely recognised and accepted by

the people, which means that the translation has succeeded.

According to the polysystem theory, various factors combine to decide whether a translation

will succeed or not, such as the translator, political elements, ideology, mainstream poetics,

sponsor and so on.

Theo Hermans, the contemporary British translation theorist, summed up the three major

elements as ideology, poetics and sponsor.

Besides, the polysystem theory lists three conditions in which translated literature will occupy

the central position in the literary polysystem of the target language.

First, the literary polysystem is still taking shape, which means that it has not been established

yet.

Second, the literary polysystem of the target language is at a marginal and/or

disadvantageous position within a larger literary system.

Third, the literature of target language is changing its direction, encountering a crisis or going

through a literary vacuum.
