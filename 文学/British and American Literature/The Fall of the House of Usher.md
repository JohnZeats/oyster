#UnrealiableNarrative 





An unnamed narrator approaches the house of Usher on a “dull, dark, and soundless day.” This house—the estate of his boyhood friend, ==Roderick Usher==—is gloomy and mysterious.
Roderick reveals that he has been hearing these sounds for days, and believes that they have buried Madeline alive and that she is trying to escape. He yells that she is standing behind the door. The wind blows open the door and confirms Roderick’s fears: ==Madeline== stands in white robes bloodied from her struggle. She attacks Roderick as the life drains from her, and he dies of fear. The narrator flees the house. As he escapes, the entire house cracks along the break in the frame and crumbles to the ground.

Gothic tale: ==a haunted house, dreary landscape, mysterious sickness, and doubled personality.== For all its easily identifiable Gothic elements, however, part of the terror of this story is its vagueness.

Poe creates a sensation of ==claustrophobia== in this story. The narrator is mysteriously trapped by the lure of Roderick’s attraction, and he cannot escape until the house of Usher collapses completely. Characters cannot move and act freely in the house because of its structure, so it assumes a monstrous character of its own—the Gothic mastermind that controls the fate of its inhabitants.
But Madeline proves central to the symmetrical and claustrophobic logic of the tale.
==Doubling== spreads throughout the story. The tale highlights the Gothic feature of the doppelganger, or character double, and portrays doubling in inanimate structures and literary forms. The narrator, for example, first witnesses the mansion as a reflection in the tarn, or shallow pool, that abuts the front of the house. The mirror image in the tarn doubles the house, but upside down—an inversely symmetrical relationship that also characterizes the relationship between Roderick and Madeline.

the place and time are both vague and ambiguous, and the sotry was totally suspended, for the atmosphere of horror and the single effect of short novel.
==Fear for no apparent reason except ambiguity itself== is an important motif in Poe's tale, which after all begins with the Narrator's description of his own irrational dread: "I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit." Later, Usher identifies fear itself as the thing that will kill him, suggesting that his own anxiety is what conjures up the blood-stained Madeline--or that she is simply a manifestation of his own deepest neuroses.


The story itself may provide an experience that demonstrates the ultimate inadequacy of human reason to understand the mysteries of creation.
