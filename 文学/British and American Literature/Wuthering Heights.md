#Gothic 
Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange
wild wind and storm, passionate and violent temper


Catherine Earnshaw and her daughter Cathy Linton 
married to Edgar Linton
wild inside and pretended to be well civilized



Healthcliff, a foundling wild, amoral, dangerous, of unknown descent.
a satanic hero and a [[Byronic hero]], reprents nature, 
a rational man who has a good heart and mind may have a dark nature, the inner darkness. 
like john milton's satan, the evil hero, the villain who is a metaphor of human rebeliousness and constant striving for individual freedom, 

in nature people find peace and comfort
