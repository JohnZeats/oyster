"These analyses seek to get beneath the surface (denotative) meanings and examine more implicit (connotative) social meanings. These approaches view culture as a narrative or story-telling process in which particular texts or cultural artifacts (i.e., a hit song or a television program) consciously or unconsciously link themselves to larger stories at play in the society." 
"A key here is how texts create subject positions or identities for those who use them." 

- ==Production analysis== asks the following kinds of questions: Who owns the media? Who creates texts and why? Under what constraints? How democratic or elitist is the production of popular culture? What about works written only for money? 
- ==Textual analysis== examines how specific works of popular culture create meanings. 
- ==Audience analysis== asks how different groups of popular culture consumers, or users, make similar or different sense of the same texts. 
- ==Historical analysis== investigates how these other three dimensions change over time. ([Guerin 2005:320](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=320))

"sometimes popular culture can so overtake and repackage a literary work that it is impossible to read the original text without reference to the many layers of popular culture that have developed around it." ([Guerin 2005:320](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=320))
