- Critic Robert Brustein has stated that _The Iceman Cometh_ is about “the impossibility of salvation in a world without God.” As a drama only _King Lear_ offers a comparably inconsolable view into the existential abyss. In American literature the play’s only rival in questioning ultimates is Herman Melville’s novel _Moby-Dick_.
- In a sense _The Iceman Cometh_ is O’Neill’s version of both _Death of a Salesman_ and _Waiting for Godot_. Hickey, the salesman of life without illusion, is eagerly awaited to enliven the denizens of Harry Hope’s Lower Manhattan dive. As in Beckett’s play, O’Neill poses <u>the fundamental modern question, What can be believed in the impossibility of any belief?</u> But unlike Godot, Hickey arrives. Like Willy Loman, Hickey is deceived about himself and the lesson he brings and, again like Willy, is ultimately aligned with death and the necessity of illusions. O’Neill’s dark parable of nothingness is one of the starkest and most unrelenting of modern dramas.
