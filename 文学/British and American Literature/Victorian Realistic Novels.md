The most popular novels of the Victorian age were ==realistic, thickly plotted, crowded with characters, and long.== Describing contemporary life and entertainment for the middle class.

- The novelists at the turn of the century continued to explore the problems in English social life, but explored other key themes as well. The greatest departure from the early Victorian era came from these authors exploration of themes such as sexuality and a focus on the ways in which science and technology would revolutionize the world in the upcoming century.

- Characteristics of the Realistic Victorian Novel
• An emphasis on the here and now  
• Attention to specific action and verifiable consequences  
• Realists evoke common actions, ==present surface details==, and emphasize the minor catastrophes of the middle class  
• They employ simple direct language and write about issues of conduct  
• Characterization is very important. There is often ==an abundance of characters and social types==

Realism was characterized by its ==attention to detail==, as well as its attempt to recreate reality as it was. As a result, plot was no longer the central to the focus of the author, but rather creating interesting and complex characters took precedence. 
Realism also placed an emphasis on describing the ==material and physical details of life, as opposed to the natural world as characterized by the Romantic period.==

Realism emphasizes ==accurate descriptions of setting, dress, and character== in ways that would have appeared inappropriate to earlier authors. Realism, which emphasizes the importance of the ordinary person and the ordinary situation, generally rejects the heroic and the aristocratic and embraces the ordinary working class citizen.


Realism had turned to Naturalism towards the end of the nineteenth century. With Naturalism, writers defined their character using their ==heredity and history==. Qualities that people found distasteful in Realism, which was the fixation with character and the thoroughly dull plots, was intensified by Naturalism. The impact was uniquely because of ==Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution== that inspired other writers to branch out into something that differs from Realism. Whereas Realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also endeavors to govern “scientifically” the underlying forces, like the heredity and history, manipulating all of the actions of the subjects.
