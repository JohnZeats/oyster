Eugene O’Neill said that his goal was “to get an audience to leave the theatre with an exultant feeling from seeing somebody on stage facing life, fighting against the eternal odds, not conquering but perhaps inevitably being conquered. ==The individual life is made significant just by the struggle==.” Struggle was a familiar subject to O’Neill.

He introduced American audiences to Realism—the idea that a play should look and sound as much as possible like real life.

-   He experimented with using simultaneous action onstage.
-   He used the “aside,” a way for characters to reveal their true thoughts by speaking directly to the audience.
-   He used masks—an unusual technique to include in contemporary drama.

O’Neill experimented with symbolism, masks, interior monologues, choruses, and realistic and expressionistic styles.

Theme:

His early plays were “slice of life” dramas, focusing on==the delusions and obsessions of marginalized characters== —seamen, laborers, roust-abouts, prostitutes, and derelicts—who had never before been depicted on the American stage. ==Most are adrift and deeply divided from their identities and the traditional sources of sustaining values==.
