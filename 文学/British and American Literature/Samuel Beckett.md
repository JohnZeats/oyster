#### Krapp's Last Tape
-  “Spiritually a year of profound gloom and indigence until that memorable night in March, at the end of the jetty, in the howling wind, never to be forgotten, when suddenly I saw the whole thing. The vision at last. . . . What I suddenly saw then was this . . . that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most.” Krapp’s revelation breaks off, but Beckett himself completed his sentence, saying “that <u>the dark I have always struggled to keep under” was “my most precious ally</u>.”
- As Beckett biographer James Knowlson summarizes, Beckett’s insight meant that he would “<u>draw henceforward on his own inner world for his subjects; outside reality  would  be  refracted  through  the  filter  of  his  own  imagination;  inner  desires  and  needs  would  be  allowed  a  much  greater  freedom  of  expression;  rational  contradictions  would  be  allowed  in;  and  the  imagination  would  be allowed to create alternative worlds to those of conventional reality.</u>” Beckett would thereby find the way to bypass the particular to deal directly with the universal.


#### End Game

In a complex essay on Samuel Beckett’s Endgame Adorno meditates on the ways in which Beckett uses form to evoke the emptiness of modern culture. Despite the catastrophes and degradations of twentieth-century history, the play suggests, we persist in behaving as if nothing has changed. We persist in our foolish belief in the old truths of the unity and substantiality of the individual or the meaningfulness of language. The play presents characters who possess only the hollow shells of individuality and the fragmented clichés of a language. The absurd discontinuities of discourse, the pared-down characterization, and plotlessness, all contribute to the aesthetic effect of distancing the reality to which the play alludes, thereby giving us a ‘negative’ knowledge of modern society.
