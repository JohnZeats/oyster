- Burroughs weaves an intricate and **horrible allegory of human greed, corruption, and debasement**




#### Naked Lunch (1959)
 ==Sexual perversion and drug addiction are central themes== in the novel, representing a shocking refutation of traditional moral values and literary conventions. Indeed, _Naked Lunch_ contains far ==more extreme pornographic elements than Joyceâ€™s own novels== that experiment with the language of illicit literature.
 
 _Naked Lunch_ has no plot, no chronology, no realistic setting, and no conventional grammar to guide confused readers.
