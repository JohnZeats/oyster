##### Theme
Initially, Huck’s conflict with society is embodied by ==the Widow Douglas==’ attempts to “sivilize” Huck and thereby make him into an upstanding citizen.==Being an upstanding citizen also means accepting slavery and institutionalized racism.==
Through witnessing the king and duke’s various scams, Huck becomes aware of Jim’s essential goodness, in contrast to the self-interested hypocrisy of most of the people they meet
Huck’s continued ambivalence toward civilization suggests that even though the particular matter of Jim’s freedom has been resolved, ==the greater immorality of society persists in the form of slavery and institutionalized racism==

The primary theme of the novel is ==the conflict between civilization and "natural life."== Huck represents natural life through his freedom of spirit, uncivilized ways, and desire to escape from civilization. He was raised without any rules or discipline and has a strong resistance to anything that might "sivilize" him. This conflict is introduced in the first chapter through the efforts of the Widow Douglas: she tries to force Huck to wear new clothes, give up smoking, and learn the Bible. Throughout the novel, Twain seems to suggest that the uncivilized way of life is more desirable and morally superior. Drawing on the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Twain suggests that civilization corrupts, rather than improves, human beings.

**Slavery** 
All along their journey downriver, Jim cares for and protects of Huck, not as a servant, but as a friend. Thus, Twain's encourages the reader to feel sympathy and empathy for Jim and outrage at the society that has enslaved him and threatened his life. However, although Twain attacks slavery through is portrayal of Jim, he never directly addresses the issue. Huck and Jim never debate slavery, and all the other slaves in the novel are very minor characters. Only in the final section of the novel does Twain develop the central conflict concerning slavery: should Huck free Jim and then be condemned to hell? This decision is life-altering for Huck, as it forces him to reject everything "civilization" has taught him. Huck chooses to free Jim, based on his personal experiences rather than social norms, thus choosing the morality of the "natural life" over that of civilization.

By focusing on Huck’s education, _Huckleberry Finn_ fits into ==the tradition of the #bildungsroman ==: a novel depicting an individual’s maturation and development. As a poor, uneducated boy, for all intents and purposes an orphan, Huck distrusts the morals and precepts of the society that treats him as an outcast and fails to protect him from abuse. This apprehension about society, and his growing relationship with Jim, lead Huck to question many of the teachings that he has received, especially regarding race and slavery. More than once, we see Huck choose to “go to hell” rather than go along with the rules and follow what he has been taught. Huck bases these decisions on his experiences, his own sense of logic, and what his developing conscience tells him.
