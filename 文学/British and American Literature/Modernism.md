[[Postmodernism]]



(Guerin, 2005):
Modernism typically displayed an emphasis on **impressionism and subjectivity**, on how subjectivity takes place, rather than on what is perceived 

Modernists deployed ==fragmented forms, discontinuous narratives, and pastiche== as in Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury* (1929). Often narratives were sparse, even minimal, as in Stevens's poetry. Modernist novels sought to be metafictive, or self-referential about their status as texts, their production as art, and their reception.
