##### Point of view and Plot
Narrated retrospectively by ==the nameless son==, now an adult, the story of his father contains in its first paragraph the seeds of the unhappy tale that follows: 
His father, says the narrator, was perfectly happy with his life as a farmhand until he learned ambition. Quite logically, the son suggests that the father probably learned this American trait when he married, late in life, the taciturn ==schoolteacher who induced her new husband to start a chicken farm.== 
From this point on, ==the narrator uses eggs and chickens to chronicle the unhappy and downward-spiraling movement of his family’s life in and near Bidwell, Ohio.==

##### The trick of egg, the climax
For a time, because they work hard, the mother and father’s business realizes a small profit. Foolishly, however, the father decides that ==he will achieve even more success if he can entertain his customers==. He tries to force a customer to look at the grotesque freak chickens—those born with two heads or five legs— that he keeps in a jar of alcohol behind the restaurant counter. The man is, predictably, sickened by the sight. When this endeavor fails, the nervous but determined father attempts two silly egg tricks in front of the reluctant customer, who tries to ignore him.
==When the tricks fail, the final blow occurs, literally, when the frustrated father throws an egg at the customer, who barely makes his escape. ==
==The pathetic father breaks down completely==; the narrator son still remembers joining his father in an outpouring of wailing and grief. Apparently the sadness continues into the narrator’s adulthood, for, as he contemplates the reason for the cycle of chicken-egg-chicken, he notes that, even all these long years later, he is his father’s son. The pessimism of those early years, along with its sense of defeat, remains in the narrator’s tone: [The American Dream](https://literariness.org/2021/04/13/african-american-drama/) remains unattainable for those who are not Lincoln or Garfield.


##### Structure
Anderson’s ==narrative strategy in this story is to reverse the traditional,== life-affirming symbol of the egg in parallel with his reversal of the traditional American myth that hard work yields success, a rise in fortunes, and happiness. 


##### Symbol: the egg
==Eggs bring nothing but worry, disease, and death==
==Eggs, traditionally a symbol of new life, are associated in Christian cultures with Easter and the resurrection of Christ==; in other cultures they have the same meaning, associated with ==spring and rebirth==. Yet the narrator seems not to see that his own birth—from an egg—also ==plays a role in the failure of his parents’ farm and, after the move to town, of their restaurant.==
