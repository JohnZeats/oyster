**The holiday setting of Epiphany** emphasizes the profoundness of Gabriel’s difficult awakening that concludes the story and the collection. 
==Gabriel's epiphany moment happened in the Epiphany party.==Gabriel experiences an inward change that makes him examine his own life and human life in general. Gabriel sees himself as a shadow of a person, flickering in a world in which the living and the dead meet. ==Though in his speech at the dinner he insisted on the division between the past of the dead and the present of the living==, Gabriel now recognizes, after hearing that Michael Furey’s memory lives on, that ==such division is false==. As he looks out of his hotel window, he sees the falling snow, and he imagines it covering Michael Furey’s grave just as it covers those people still living, as well as the entire country of Ireland.
**The Morkans’ party consists of the kind of deadening routines** that make existence so lifeless in _Dubliners_. The events of the party repeat each year: Gabriel gives a speech, Freddy Malins arrives drunk, everyone dances the same memorized steps, everyone eats. Like the horse that circles around and around the mill in Gabriel’s anecdote, these Dubliners settle into an expected routine at this party. ==Such tedium fixes the characters in a state of paralysis==. They are unable to break from the activities that they know, so they live life without new experiences, numb to the world. Even ==the food on the table evokes death==. The life-giving substance appears at “rival ends” of the table that is lined with parallel rows of various dishes, divided in the middle by “sentries” of fruit and watched from afar by “three squads of bottles.” The military language transforms a table set for a communal feast into a battlefield, reeking with danger and death.


The Dead is a short story by James Joyce, and it is the final story in his collection Dubliners. The story takes place at a dinner party in Dublin, Ireland, and the setting is a crucial aspect of the story's themes and meanings. The dinner party is held at the home of the protagonist's aunts, and the story explores the relationships between the guests and the ways in which they are all connected through their shared history and experiences in Dublin. The dinner party also serves as a microcosm of Dublin society, highlighting the stifling nature of social conventions and the loneliness and isolation that can result from living in a tightly knit community. The setting of The Dead is closely related to the story's themes of isolation, connection, and the limitations of social norms.



##### Character and the last scene
==Gabriel== gazes out of his hotel window, watching the falling snow and reflecting on ==his wife Gretta’==s recent confession about ==her childhood love, Michael Furey.== 
Previously in the story, Gabriel had been intoxicated and energized by Gretta’s preoccupied mood, which reminded him of their courtship, but her outburst of sobbing undermines his self-assurance. This quiet moment of contemplation portrays Gabriel’s muted, hushed acceptance that he was not Gretta’s first love, and that in fact he has never felt love at all. The blanket of snow suggests this sense of ==numbness in Gabriel’s character==—he is ==literally frigid to emotion==—but also the commonality of this trait. The snow does not fall only outside of Gabriel’s window, but, as he envisions it, across the country, from the Harbor of Dublin in the east, to the south in Shannon, and to the west. In other words, everyone, ==everywhere, is as numb as he is==.**spiritual paralysis**
How his living experience intersects with death and the dead
==Gabriel== is short temper, acute class consciousness, social awkwardness, and frustrated love.




##### plot and character
**Gabriel and his wife Gretta entered in the party**
At the annual dance and dinner party held by Kate and Julia Morkan and their young niece, Mary Jane Morkan, the housemaid Lily frantically greets guests. Set at or just before the feast of the Epiphany on January 6, which celebrates the manifestation of Christ’s divinity to the Magi, the party draws together a variety of relatives and friends.
**confronting lily**
Gabriel clumsily provokes a defensive statement from the overworked Lily when he asks her about her love life. Instead of apologizing or explaining what he meant, Gabriel quickly ends the conversation by giving Lily a holiday tip. He blames his prestigious education for his inability to relate to servants like Lily, but his willingness to let money speak for him suggests that he relies on the comforts of his class to maintain distance. The encounter with Lily shows that Gabriel, like his aunts, cannot tolerate a “back answer,” but he is unable to avoid such challenges as the party continues

**question wth Miss Ivors**
During his dance with Miss Ivors, he faces a barrage of questions about his nonexistent nationalist sympathies, which he doesn’t know how to answer appropriately. Unable to compose a full response, Gabriel blurts out that he is sick of his own country, surprising Miss Ivors and himself with his unmeasured response and his loss of control.

**in the hotel with Gretta and Michael Furey**
Gabriel’s unease culminates in his tense night with Gretta, and his final encounter with her ultimately forces him to confront his stony view of the world. When he sees Gretta transfixed by the music at the end of the party, Gabriel yearns intensely to have control of her strange feelings. Though Gabriel remembers their romantic courtship and is overcome with attraction for Gretta, this attraction is rooted not in love but in his desire to control her. At the hotel, when Gretta confesses to Gabriel that she was thinking of her first love, he becomes furious at her and himself, realizing that he has no claim on her and will never be “master.” After Gretta falls asleep, Gabriel softens. Now that he knows that another man preceded him in Gretta’s life, he feels not jealousy, but sadness that Michael Furey once felt an aching love that he himself has never known. Reflecting on his own controlled, passionless life, he realizes that life is short, and those who leave the world like Michael Furey, ==with great passion, in fact live more fully than people like himself.==

When they arrived at their hotel room, Gabriel realises that his wife is remembering the tragic death of Michael Furey as he was making the journey to visit Gretta. He realises that she will always love Furey, and that Furey loved her in a way that he cannot compete with. ==He is humbled by this realisation, which amounts to his own epiphany: an awareness that takes him outside of his own thoughts and self-absorption and makes him view his wife, and by extension, all of humanity in a new way.==


##### theme
- **intersection of life and death**
But this time, rather than throwing back a self-image, the window opens out onto the world of snow, the cold weather that had done for Michael Furey all of those years ago, and ==the suggestion of commonalty and kinship with every other soul in Ireland== (==the living and the dead==, as the final words of the story make clear).


- **spiritual paralysis of dubliners** 

- **Epiphany** 
We all get swept up in moments which we think are going to define our lives and change our outlooks forever, but it’s often harder for us to change our ways as a result of one ‘lightbulb’ moment like this
