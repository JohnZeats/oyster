- **Self-awareness of the Boy**
	- The most important aspect of ‘Araby’ is the sudden self-awareness of the boy. Before his arrival at ‘Araby’ he was leading as it were a curtained life. Nothing mattered to him except love and romance. Though there remained the odours of ashpits and stables, the rough treatment at the hands of cottagers who lived in dark muddy lanes, the harsh and unpleasant noises near markets, Mrs Mercer’s long and tiring talk over the evening meal, and the uncle’s non-cooperative attitude, ==the boy did not take them seriously as he imagined himself bearing his chalice safely through a throng of foes==. But his sensitive and romantic nature received a severe jolt when the young lady rudely asked him if he wanted to buy anything thereby reminding him of his cash position-a poor position that did not permit him to buy the jars even after his selection of them as fit objects of gift for his beloved. As the light went out, he realized for the first time that it was his vanity-his high notion about himself that he would be able to buy a fine gift for his beloved–that brought him to the bazaar. This vanity proving empty was also responsible for his humiliation. He suffered from anguish–the cause of his great mental pain being his inability to buy the thing he promised to his beloved. His eyes also burned in anger at himself at his dependence on others, at his powerlessness in giving a present to one whom he loved best.
	- 一个进入现实的旅程，他精准的优美的描绘出了一个基本的进入现实的精神体验，一开始他不是自由的，他一定是被语言禁令和恐惧欲望及周遭所塑造的一个主体，但是他的nature会再一个时刻遇到一面墙，遇到那个不和谐的瞬间，然后他会在那一瞬间跃出水面，感受到真正的那个自己，一股不断涌动的力量，或者说，不是真正的自己，而是一股生命力量之流，历史涌现的力量，人的精神主体发展的驱动力量，
	- 对于自身主体的探索和把握是这个时代的主题
