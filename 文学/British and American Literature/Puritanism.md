#puritan 
- A political and religious movement developed in England in 16th century, and then in New England, is the aftermath of renaissance
- Calvinism, **predestination**, **original sin**, total depravity, limited atonement
	- the Puritans believed that **the Elect** were predestined by God to instinctively be moral and go to heaven, and so doing good became a tool for proving that a person was part of the Elect and a rightful member of the Puritan community rather than a legitimate expression of oneâ€™s internal moral compass.
- based on the teaching of the Bible, the church should restored to the purity of the first-century church as established by Jesus himself
- practical idealist, doctrine opportunist
