Ostranenie is the artistic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way so they could gain ==new perspectives== and see the world differently.

[Shklovsky](Viktor%20Shklovsky) invented the term as a means to "==distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former's perceptibility==.

This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of "over-automatization

This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:
> The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects 'unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because ==the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself== and must be prolonged.

审美过程本身就是作品本身的审美价值的一部分，所以形式非常重要
