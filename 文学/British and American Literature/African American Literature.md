#### the main characteristics 
([Guerin 2005:306](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=306)):
- African American writing displays a folkloric conception of huamankind
- an ambivalent consciousness arising from bicultural identity
- to negotiating this ambivalence, parody, irony and sometimes biter comedy were employed
- attacks upon presumed white cultural superiority
- a naturalistic focus on survival
- and inventive reframings of language itself


"Bernard Bell reviews some primary features of African American writing and compares value systems: Traditional white American values emanate from a providential vision of history and of Euro-Americans as **a chosen people,** a vision that sanctions their individual and collective freedom in the pursuit of property, profit, and happiness. **Radical Protestantism, Constitutional democracy, and industrial capitalism are the white American trinity of values**. 

In contrast, black American values emanate from a cyclical, Judeo-Christian vision of history and of African-Americans as a disinherited, colonized people, a vision that sanctions their resilience of spirit and pursuit of social justice.
