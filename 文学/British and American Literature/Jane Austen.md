lives and thoughts of the commonplace people of the uppermiddle class.
literary satire accompanies the comic depiction of character and society.




#### Sense and Sensibility (1811)



#### [[Pride and Prejudice]] (1813)





#### Mansfield Park (1814)
A young girl named ==Fanny Price== comes to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram

==A young woman trying to find her place in the social order==. Fanny comes from a poor family but is being raised by her rich aunt and uncle

Like other Austen heroines, Fanny will, in part, determine her status by marrying. ==Since women could not enter the professions, **marriage** was the only way, in the nineteenth century, to ascend or descend the social ladder.== Fanny's mother has fallen downwards quite a bit through her own marriage to a sailor who turns out to be a drunk; her aunt Lady Bertram and her cousin Maria, on the other hand, do fairly well by marrying. While the marriages of others have been formulated based on beauty and family connections, Fanny is to "earn" a marriage partner based on her character. ==Virtue== is definitely rewarded in this world, and it is the primary determinant of an individual's eventual fate.	

whether "nature"--one's innate qualities--or "nurture"--the environment in which one is raised--is the primary determinant of character.
The idea of education is a part of this debate: can people change?
