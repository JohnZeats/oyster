### Who coined the term and what is Archetype in literature?
*Carl Jung* who believed that archetypes are part of humanity's collective unconscious or memory of universal experiences.
In psychology, an archetype is a basic structure of human experience that forms the core of **many different individual personalities**.
In a literary context, characters (and sometimes images or themes) that ==symbolically embody universal meanings and basic human experiences, independent of time or place, are considered archetypes.==
Archetypal pictures and tale patterns ==urge readers to engage ritualistically in their generation's underlying beliefs, fears, and worries==. Thus, archetypal reading can be considered ==an indirect form of== #psychoanalysis.
Archetypal reading focuses on how symbols are combined within stories and poems to create meanings beyond **the original intent** of the author.
Writers often use familiar images and objects **to help them express ideas.** These elements are called "archetypes." The archetype is the basic pattern or model that shapes something complex, such as a poem or story.


Writers employ them to **build a bond between the audience and the work** of literature being presented.
