##### Character
==Mary== has returned to her family recently after receiving treatment in a sanatorium for morphine addiction.
==Edmund== , meanwhile, has in recent weeks begun to cough very violently, and we learn later on in the play that, as Tyrone and Jamie suspect, he has tuberculosis.
==James Tyrone==, for example, is constantly blamed for his own stinginess, which may have led to Mary's morphine addiction when he refused to pay for a good doctor to treat the pain caused by childbirth.
They all argue over ==Jamie and Edmund's failure== to become successes as their father had always hoped they would become.

##### Plot

Mary, on the other hand, is never able to let go of the past or admit to the painful truth of the present, the truth that she is addicted to morphine and her youngest son has tuberculosis.

Most of the plot of the play is repetitious, just as the cycle of an alcoholic is repetitious.

As the day progresses, Mary becomes more and more affected by the morphine that she takes. And the men become increasingly drunk.


##### Setting
all in the living room

##### Point of view


##### Structure
The repetitious plot also helps develop the notion that this day is not remarkable in many ways. Instead, it is one in a long string of similar days for the Tyrones, filled with bitterness, fighting, and an underlying love.
All acts are set in the living room, and all scenes but the last occur either just before or just after a meal. Act II, Scene i is set before lunch; scene ii after lunch; and Act III before dinner. Each act focuses on interplay between two specific characters: Act I features Mary and Tyrone; Act II Tyrone and Jamie, and Edmund and Mary; Act III Mary and Jamie; Act IV Tyrone and Edmund, and Edmund and Jamie.

##### Atmosphere


##### Theme
is undoubtedly a tragedy--it leaves the audience with a sense of ==catharsis==, or emotional rebirth through the viewing of powerful events, and it depicts the fall of something that was once great.
It’s a story of love, hate, betrayal, addiction, blame, and the fragility of family bonds—particularly between #fathersandsons.
guilt, vulnerability, and the need for family connection

##### Style


##### Symbol and Irony
the fog that eventually overtakes the house is a metaphor (or symbol) for something else. O’Neill shows us that the literal fog represents the fog of addiction. No one is able to escape.

the light 

the play’s title metaphor of a journey toward closure, toward the ==dark recognition of frustration, disappointment==, and mortality also implies a dawn of sorts, if only in the shattering illumination of naked truths
