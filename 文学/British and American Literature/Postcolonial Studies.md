"Postcolonialism refers to a historical phase undergone by Third World countries after the decline of colonialism: for example, when countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean separated from the European empires and were left to rebuild themselves." 

"Postcolonial literary theorists study the English language within this ==politicized context==, especially those writings that developed at the colonial "front," such as works by ==Rudyard Kipling, E. M. Forster, Jean Rhys, or Jamaica Kincaid.==" ([Guerin 2005:321](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=321))

"Works such as *The Empire Writes Back*, edited by Bill Ashcroft and others, and *The Black Atlantic* by Paul Gilroy have radically remapped cultural criticism." ([Guerin 2005:321](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=321))

"Said's ==concept of orientalism== was an important touchstone to postcolonial studies, as he described the stereotypical discourse about the East as constructed by the West. This discouse, rather than realistically portraying Eastern II others," constructs them based upon Western anxieties and preoccupations. Said sharply critiques the Western image of the Oriental as "irrational, depraved (fallen), child-like, 'different,"' which has allowed the West to define itself as "rational, virtuous, mature, 'normal'"" ([Guerin 2005:321](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=321))

"Postcolonial literatures from emerging nations by such writers as [[Chinua Achebe]] and Salman Rushdie are read alongside European responses to colonialism by writers such as ==George Orwell and Albert Camus==." ([Guerin 2005:322](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DFVY3L3?page=322))
