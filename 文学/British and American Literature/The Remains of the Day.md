English aristocratic novel; tragedy; pre-World War II novel

##### Character
==Stevens the butler==
==Lord Darlington==
==Miss Kenton==
his relentless pursuit of "dignity" leads him to constantly deny his own feelings throughout the novel. He never tells anyone what he is truly feeling, and he gives his absolute trust to Lord Darlington—a man who himself makes some very poor choices in his life. Although throughout much of the story it seems that Stevens is quite content to have served Lord Darlington—believing that Darlington was doing noble things at the time—Stevens expresses deep regret at the end of the story for failing to cultivate both intimate relationships and his own personal viewpoints and experiences.
==Stevens is alternately a narrator who is superior to the story he tells, and a narrator who is a part of, or within, the story he tells.==
Ishiguro ==subtly increases the amount of doubt== that Stevens expresses about his past actions, so that by the end of the story, a fuller picture of Stevens's regret and sadness has emerged.
