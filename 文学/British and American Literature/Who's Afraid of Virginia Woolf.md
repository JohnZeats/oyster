##### Character and Plot
**George** Washington the first president of America
	A patricide(弑父)
	A history professor, 代表着过去传统信仰，人文主义学者

and his wife Massachussetts

Nick
	生物学，代表着现代科技的威胁

==George and Martha== coming home from a party at her father's house. The two of them clearly care deeply for each other, but events have turned their marriage into a nasty battle between two disenchanted, cynical enemies. Even though the pair arrives home at two o'clock in the morning, they are expecting guests: the new math professor and his wife.

Of course, as it turns out, this new, ==young professor, Nick, actually works in the biology department==. ==He and his wife, Honey==, walk into a brutal social situation.

In the first act, "Fun and Games," Martha and George try to ==fight and humiliate each other== in new, inventive ways. As they ==peel away each other's pretenses and self-respect==, George and Martha use Honey and Nick as pawns, ==transforming their guests into an audience to witness humiliation==, into levers for creating jealousy, and into a means for expressing their own sides of their mutual story. In the second act, "Walpurgisnacht," these games get even nastier. The evening turns into a nightmare. George and Martha even ==attack Honey and Nick==, attempting to force them to reveal their dirty secrets and true selves. Finally, in the last act, "The Exorcism," everyone's secrets have been revealed and purged. Honey and Nick go home, leaving Martha and George to try to ==rebuild their shattered marriage==.

Having divested themselves of the fantasies that have ruled and sustained them, George and Martha confront themselves and their reality with sorrow for their loss and uncertainty about their future.


##### Setting
the campus of a small, New England university.
==The importance of a happy family was emphasized by both politicians and popular culture.== Many Americans considered success to be measured by having one's own house, car, kids, and dog. By all ==shallow measures==, the 1950s were a stable, productive time for the United States of America. And yet, these shallow measures and the trappings of success often hid real problems, which will eventually crop up in any human community. It is this raw, human truth beneath the phony exterior that Edward Albee attempts to reveal in _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?._

##### Point of view


##### Structure


##### Atmosphere


##### Theme
He brings up the idea of ==private and public images in marriage.== Inherent in this idea of public and private faces is the theme of ==phoniness.== Many couples, Albee seems to say, project false images of themselves in public situations. In fact, that phoniness is generally preferred to exposing all of one's problems and indiscretions to the world.

-  [[Illusion]] and fantasies  of middle class Americans in everyday life to ease the pain, the spiritual #emptinessof1960 and meaninglessness, nonetheless creating illusion is necessary for surviving in modern world, 
> Their work echoed their lifestyles: ==fiercely intellectual and explosively self-destructive, classical and alcoholic, suicidal and visionary==.

Childlessness is the main problem,
	[[Impotent]]
Never success 
	lack of success at his job.


the play forwards the thought that none of the characters is ready to have children in part because they are all ==living like children themselves.==


Phoniness
	private and public images in marriage




##### Style


##### Symbol and Irony

the title means a lot
she was a famous modren writer and the couples were well read and has the respect to language. Whem Martha is young, she has ever identified herself as talented and wit Woolf 
and she was afraid of suicide(face the desperation of life itself), and her whole life was based and maintained by the illusion of having a virtual son.
and woolf is the homophone of wolf, ==who's afraid of the big bad wolf ==, represents dangers and terrible things like poverty and in this play for four charcters is ==hopelessness==

Albee has explicated his title with its reference to a writer centrally concerned with the ==nature of reality==, to mean “==Who is afraid of facing life without illusions?==” The question serves as the play’s repeated refrain and ultimatum.

==Education== fails to bring wisdom and happiness to them
==Religion== also fails
==wolf==, represents the danger of looking at life closely, the abyss of life, and then illusions are important for maintaining normal life
==Children==, the oject of their desire which is promised to bring fulfillment
