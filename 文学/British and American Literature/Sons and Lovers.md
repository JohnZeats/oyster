	- 同样是工人阶级的代表，一个是无言的暴力的底层男性，一个是充满吸引力的，都是粗鲁的

### Character
- **Walter Morel**, the father
	- Morel has what the novel takes to be a characteristically proletarian inarticulateness, physicality and passivity: Sons and Lovers portrays the miners as **creatures of the underworld** who live the life of the body rather than the mind.
- **Mrs Morel**, the mother
	- **lower-middle-class origin, reasonably well-educated, articulate and determined**. She therefore symbolizes what the young, sensitive and artistic Paul may hope to achieve

### Plot


### Setting


### Point of view
- Paul's own viewpoint is the only way we go through the whole novel.
	- As Paul moves into the foreground of the story, **his father recedes into the background**.
	- 整个叙事过程也是一个探索他母亲的内心世界的过程，这个视角的演进对应了主题和主角的关注点，这是一个形式安排的手法，
	- The novel is also in general more 'inward' in its treatment of Mrs Morel than it is of her husband; indeed we might argue that it is organized in a way which tends to highlight her and obscure him, a formal device which reinforces the protagonist's own attitudes.

### Structure


### Atmosphere


### Theme
- Paul's emotional turning to her from the father is, inseparably, a turning from the impoverished, exploitative world of the colliery towards the life of emancipated consciousness. 从父亲的意识走向母亲的意识的转变
