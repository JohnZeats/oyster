##### Theme

- Find the barriers in their heart and then overcome them
- Throughout Pride and Prejudice, pride prevents the characters from seeing the truth of a situation.
- Darcy's pride in his social position leads him to scorn anyone outside of his own social circle. 
- Meanwhile, Elizabeth's pride in her powers of discernment cloud her judgment.
- **gender injustice**, women were only to marry for financial security, though Elizabeth, she shows that women are just ass intelligent and capable as their male counterparts.
- **she should only marry for love** 
- social institution are to server human happiness 门当户对
- the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.
	- Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. 在失败的父母的教育环境里面去找寻真正的自己，
	- The search for self,  is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery. 寻找自我的旅程也可以在客厅里人与人的对话里进行，在头脑里就已经有足够大的宇宙去冒险了



##### Style
- **Free indirect speech**, 
	- which has been defined as "the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke"
