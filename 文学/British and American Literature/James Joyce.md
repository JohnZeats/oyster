##### Epiphany: the key feature
A realisation or revelation experienced by a central character in the story. This epiphany often provides a similar function to a plot twist or denouement in a more traditional (i.e., plot-driven) story: at the end of a detective story the mystery is solved and the criminal unmasked, for instance.


##### Paralysis and Irish

Joyce said that he wrote the short stories that make up _Dubliners_==in order to give Ireland one good look at itself in the mirror== : his vision of Ireland is an unflinchingly realist ‘warts and all’ depiction of a country which, especially in those early works, seems gripped by a ==paralysis== (a key word for _Dubliners_) that is partly a result of the country’s ==obsession with its own past and with Catholicism.==


##### Irish theme
Ireland his homeland in his depiction, is a dreary and paralyzed town, smothered(suffocated ) by tradition and hopelessness. 
Ireland was still a ==colony== of Britain.
==Nationalism== had not freed the people's spirits, merely caged them in another terrible, largely unthinking ideology.
