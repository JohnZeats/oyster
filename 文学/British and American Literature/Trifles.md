- The **quilt** is a subtle but complex symbol of Mrs. Wright's struggle in her marriage.
	- Through this pattern, Mrs. Wright was attempting to construct a warm and peaceful life which contrasts her abusive reality.
	- The only way Mrs. Wright could have a peaceful life was by murdering her husband and going to jail.
	- The piecing of the quilt also symbolizes the communicative nature of quilting, as the two women use the quilt to interpret Mrs. Wright's story "patch by patch."
- Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find **the dead canary** hidden in Mrs. Wright's things and realize that Mr. Wright strangled it. The deceased canary signifies Mr. Wright's silencing of Mrs. Wright, who was cut off from the community and prevented from having contact to the world outside their farmhouse.
- **The rocking chair** serves as a presence for Mrs. Wright since she is never actually present throughout the play.
- The jar of preserves symbolizes Mrs. Wright's relationship with her husband.
	- After her arrest, the jar has frozen and burst because of the coldness of the untended, empty farmhouse. This echoes the lack of warmth in Mrs. Wright's life, whose isolation and abuse caused her to "explode" and murder her husband.
