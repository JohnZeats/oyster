The protagonist of _Never Let Me Go_, a soft science fiction novelis Kathy H., a thirty-year-old clone. Kathy echoes the quiet dignity with which Stevens assesses his fate in The Remains of the Day.

The most striking feature of Never Let Me Go is the quietly detached narrative of Kathy. Through her memory, Ishiguro creates the apparently idyllic boarding school of Hailsham, where Kathy and her fellow clones are groomed for ==a fate hidden behind euphemistic language.== The young adults are told they will become “donors” until they “complete”—that is, die—while “carers” like Kathy support them until it is the carers’ turn to become donors as well.

Ishiguro masterfully mixes the outrageous premises of his plot with the basic normalcy of Kathy and her friends.

It is also important to look closely at the opening page of the novel. Kathy assumes the reader has a certain amount of prior knowledge about life in the society in which she lives, but of course they do not. This makes the opening quite confusing until certain details become apparent as the novel progresses. For example, the reader is unclear why Kathy does not provide her full surname, what the role of a carer actually entails, I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years, and what being a donor is all about, My donors have always tended to do much better than expected. The reader is also unaware what Kathy means when she says, I’m a Hailsham student – which is enough by itself to get people’s backs up. Kathy’s narration is intriguing, it provides questions but very few answers and therefore the reader is drawn into her narrative in their determination to find out more.

her narration is not straightforward or chronological, as she tends to jump from recalling one incident to another in a very non-linear way.
