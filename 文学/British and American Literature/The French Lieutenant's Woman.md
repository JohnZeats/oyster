The subject of this novel is essentially the same as that of his other works: ==the relationship between life and art, the artist and his creation, and the isolation resulting from an individual's struggle for selfhood.==

The artificial nature of fiction

##### Plot


##### Setting
nineteenth-century victorian Britain
this is the basic time and space setting for the story of the innner story 

Fowles is as concerned with the details of the setting as were his Victorian counterparts. But he is also conscious that he is setting a scene and does not hesitate to intrude into the narrative himself in order to show the reader how he manipulates reality through his art. Like Dickens, Fowles uses dialogue to reveal the personalities of his characters and often he will satirize them as well.

##### Theme
Fowles is concerned in this novel with ==the effects of society on the individual's awareness of himself or herself and how that awareness dominates and distorts his or her entire life, including relationships with other people.== All the main characters in this novel are molded by what they believe to be true about themselves and others. In this case, their lives are governed by what the Victorian Age thought was true about the nature of men and women and their relationships to each other. The French Lieutenant's Woman 	of the title, for example, is the dark, mysterious woman of the typical Victorian romantic novel.

We can split the theme of =='**freedom**'== in _The French Lieutenant's Woman_ into different types of freedom - some large, some small, some within the context of the novel, and some on the level of meta-fiction.
But not all the characters feel free to act on the world around them, and some doubt that they can shape their own destinies at all through their willpower. Typically, people throughout history have felt some degree of free will, but this period is interesting, because it sees the introduction of ==Darwinism==. Although a scientific theory, Darwinism also can be interpreted philosophically: it seems to imply ==determinism== and therefore lack of freedom. We are what we are because of millions of years of evolution, and to think that our actions are the products of our own unique consciousness and will is a delusion.

==The characters could turn back, but they are already entrapped in a way by virtue of their repeated chance encounters, that throw them together and make the turning-back much more difficult.==

==**Sex**==
#Sexuality 
Fowles shows us in the novel that ==Victorian prudery is more complicated than we might initially think== - it isn't by any means universal, and it depends heavily on class and gender.
The lower classes seem to take ==a healthier view of sex==, or at least a less repressed one
==Denial of sexual feelings and interaction is primarily the business of the upper classes==, whether they are nouveau riche like Ernestina or aristocratic like Charles.

==**Darwinism**==
Thanks to Darwin's ideas, the Victorians are beginning to realize that everything "is in reality a continuous flux," and species that we recognize have changed and will continue to change over time (45). Nothing is stable, and soon nothing will be quite as it was. Of course, the Victorians do not like this idea, since they are very attached to their traditions, and are very conservative in many ways. There are many huge social changes taking place during this era: changes in the position of women, in the traditional class system structure, and in people's attitudes toward religion, sex, and a host of other things. It seems that the shift to the Darwinian perspective precipitates and mirrors other shifts in the Victorian consciousness.

==Mystery and uncertainty - the **unknowable**==
Doctor Grogan says of Sarah's incomprehensible sadness that Charles' "ammonites will never hold such mysteries as that," suggesting that the emotional realm of humanity is far less penetrable than science would have us think
