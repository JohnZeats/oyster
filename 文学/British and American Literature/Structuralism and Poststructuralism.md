### Intertextuality
At almost the same time, students of the English Romantic period developed parallel conceptions of the intertextuality of literature and history, and similar views that the "representations" in literary texts are not reflectors of reality but "concretized" forms of ideology.(from A glossary of literary terms: [[New Historicism]])

The term intertextuality, popularized especially by [[Julia Kristeva]], is used to signify the multiple ways in which any one literary text is made up of other texts, by means of its open or covert citations and allusions, its repetitions and transformations of the formal and substantive features of earlier texts, or simply its unavoidable participation in the common stock of linguistic and literary conventions and procedures that are "always already" in place and constitute the discourses into which we are born. In Kristeva's formulation, accordingly, any text is in fact an "intertext"—the site of an intersection of numberless other texts, and existing only through its relations to other texts.(from A glossary of literary terms: Text and Writing(Écriture ))

[[Roland Barthes]] in S/Z (1970) proposed a distinction between a text which is "lisible" (readable) and one which, although "scriptible" (writable) is "illisible" (unreadable). Readable texts are traditional or "classical" ones—such as the realistic novels by Honoré Balzac and other nineteenth-century authors—which for the most part conform to the prevailing codes and conventions, literary and social, and so are readily and comfortably interpretable and naturalizable in the process of reading. An "unreadable" text (such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, or the French new novel, or a poem by a highly experimental poet) is one which largely violates, parodies, or innovates upon prevailing conventions, and thus persistently shocks, baffles, and frustrates standard expectations. In Barthes' view an unreadable text, by drawing attention in this way to the pure conventionality and artifice of literature, laudably destroys any illusion that it represents social reality. In The Pleasure of the Text (published 1973), Barthes assigns to the readable text the response of mere "plaisir" (quasi-erotic pleasure), but to the unreadable text the response of "jouissance" (orgasmic ecstasy); as Jonathan Culler has put Barthes' view, jouissance is "a rapture of dislocation produced by ruptures or violations of intelligibility" (Structuralist Poetics, p. 192).

Intertextual figures include ==allusion, quotation, calque, plagiarism, translation, pastiche and parody==.It is a literary device that creates an 'interrelationship between texts' and generates related understanding in separate works. These references are made to influence the reader and add layers of depth to a text, ==based on the readers' prior knowledge and understanding.==

It has two types: ==referential and typological intertextuality==. Referential intertextuality refers to the use of fragments in texts and the ==typological intertextuality refers to the use of pattern and structure in typical texts.==

For Kristeva, "==the notion of intertextuality replaces the notion of intersubjectivity==" when we realize that meaning is not transferred directly from writer to reader but instead is mediated through, or filtered by, "codes" imparted to the writer and reader by other texts.

the linguistic studies of Saussure, dinstinguished signnifier and signified, many tries to explore the structure of huamn thought and behaviours, scholars behaves like an allien species, always tring to say that, you are not a man of freedom, you are a tiny part of a big mechanism, 
like Freudian, desire, sex, prototype, pattern ,complex, oral sex, ano sex, and Marx's productive force, and the basic relationship of productive unit, the material and the capital are all determinated by sex, life lower, and Darwin's claim about evolution

surplus value of human, out of commercial activities are the fuel out of all the people, we desire more and produce more, never cease.
