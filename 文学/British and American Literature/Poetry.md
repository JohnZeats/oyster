## Language Traits, Rhyme and Rhythm
- **Repetition**: reinforce the repressive, suffocating, nervous, tension feeling, 
- **Enjambment:** the continuation of a sentence or clause over a line-break. It is the running on of a sense from one line to the next without a major pause or break.  This is a way of creating audible interest. They often do not have punctuation at the end, have a fast rhythm, and create a natural sense of motion. 
- **Dialect**, linked with identity and society and certain movement
- **Capitalization and Punctuation**, Emily Dickinson
- **Juxtaposition:** a technique where two or more ideas, places, characters, and actions are set side-by-side to draw comparisons and contrasts.
- **Euphony:** the use of words and phrases that have a melody in the sound created. The word has a soothing effect due to repeated vowels, harmonious consonants (L, M, N, R, F, V, etc.), or semi-vowels (W, S, Y, th-, wh-, etc.).Euphonious words have been bolded below in _Ode to Autumn_ by John Keats.

_“**Season** of **mists** and **mellow** fruitfulness,  
__Close bosom-**friend** of the **maturing** sun;  
__Conspiring with him how to **load** and bless  
__With **fruit** the **vines** that found the **thatch** -eves run;  
__To bend with apples the **moss’d** cottage-trees,  
__And **fill** all **fruit** with **ripeness** to the core;  
__To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells  
__**With** a sweet kernel; to set budding more,  
__And still more, later flowers for the bees…”_
- **Cacophony:** contrary to euphony, cacophony is a mixture of harsh and inharmonious sounds. They are usually combined into phrases for a strong effect. This is primarily achieved through harsh consonants with explosive delivery (P, B, D, G, K, ch-, sh-, etc.). The bolded words below are examples of cacophonous words in _The Bridge_ by Hart Crane.


 _The nasal whine of power whips a new universe…  
__Where **spouting pillars spoor** the evening sky,  
__Under the looming stacks of the gigantic power house  
__Stars prick the eyes with sharp **ammoniac** proverbs,  
__New verities, new inklings in the velvet hummed  
__Of dynamos, where **hearing’s leash is strummed**…  
__Power’s script, – wound, **bobbin-bound**, refined –  
__Is stopped to the slap of belts on booming **spools, spurred  
**__Into the **bulging bouillon**, harnessed jelly of the stars.”_


- **Synethesia:** a blending or mingling of different senses. The symbolist movement of the 19th century popularized it, named in reference to the medical condition where one of the five senses simultaneously stimulates another sense. Effects include textual amplification, complication, and richness. It is used to draw out a response from readers by stimulating multiple senses. A great example is another Emily Dickinson poem entitled “Dying.”

_“With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,_  
_Between the light and me;_  
_And then the windows failed, and then_  
_could not see to see.”_

- **Alliteration**: pleasing to the ear, emphasizing the words

notice unconventional use of language and grammar, the effect, the effectiveness 
the meaning of structure 



## Mood and Tone
- **Mood** refers to the feeling the audience gets from the writing.
- **Tone** refers to the attitude the writer has towards the subject they are writing about. The tone of a poem could be **satirical, serious, humorous, critical, appreciative, fomal, intimate, outspoken and reticent, solemn and playful, angry and loving, serious and ironic.**
- **Devices** include metaphors, personification, flashbacks, symbolism, diction,

the mood shift in the poem, and how the mood develop, how the mood achieved through other methods 


## Imagery, Sensory Language and Literary Devices
- Imagery is an author’s use of descriptive language to build visuals.
- Sensory language is words and phrases that create vividity in writing. This vividness is created by appealing to the senses.

The resulting effect is a vivid and entrancing poem. This effect can be analyzed in terms of how it’s achieved, the impact it creates, and how it supports the theme of the poem.
