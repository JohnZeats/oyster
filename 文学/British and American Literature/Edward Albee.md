#TheatreofAbsurd

#### The Zoo Story (1959)
#### [[The American Dream]] (1960)
#### [[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]] (1962)

Absurdist theatre although he himself did not like this, who prefer realistic and naturalistic as the proper description


the shattering of complacency, the connection between love and aggression, and the relationship between fantasy and reality are the main themes
