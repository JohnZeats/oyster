[[Modernism]]


(Guerin, 2005):
Postmodernism questions everything ==rationalist European philosophy held to be true==, arguing that it is all contingent and that most cultural constructions have served the function of empowering members of a dominant social group at the expense of "others." (Guerin, 2005)

Postmodernism borrows from modernism 
==disillusionment with the givens of society==; 
==a penchant for irony==; 
==the self-conscious "play" within the work of art==; 
==fragmentation and ambiguity==; 
==a destructured, decentered, dehumanized subject==.

But while modernism presented a fragmented view of human history, this fragmentation was seen as tragic. Despite their pessimism, modernist works still hope, following Matthew Arnold a generation before, that art may be able to provide the ==unity, coherence, and meaning== that has been lost in most of modern life, as church and nation have failed to do. One can locate this hope, faint as it sometimes is, in such memorable passages as the Molly Bloom section that closes Joyce's Ulysses (1922). In contrast, postmodernism not only does not mourn the loss of meaning, but ==celebrates the activity of fragmentation==. Whereas modernism still seeks a rational meaning in a work of art, postmodernism ==explores the provisionality and irrationality of art==.

But postmodernism, Lyotard adds, is characterized by "==incredulity toward metanarratives==" that serve to mask the contradictions and instabilities inherent in any social organization. Postmodernism prefers "mini-narratives" of local events.

"Perhaps postmodernism is best compared to ==the emergence of computer technology==. In the future, anything not digitizable may cease to be knowledge. For Baudrillard, postmodernism marks a culture composed "of ==disparate fragmentary experiences and images that constantly bombard the individual in music, video, television, advertising and other forms of electronic media. The speed and ease of reproduction of these images mean that they exist only as image, devoid of depth, coherence, or originality==" (in Childers and Hentzi 235). Postmodernism thus reflects both the energy and diversity of contemporary life as well as its frequent ==lack of coherence and depth==. The lines between reality and artifice can become so blurred that reality TV is now hard to distinguish from reality-and from television entertainment."
