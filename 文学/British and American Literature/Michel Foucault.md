#### Power, knowledge and discourse,

knowledge is not stable and neutral as we normally think, but is always dominated by power.
Nietzsche, who said that people first decide what they want and then fit the facts to their aim: ‘Ultimately, man finds in things nothing but what he himself has imported into them.’ All knowledge is an expression of the ‘Will to Power’.

He deduced that the rules and procedures which determine what is considered normal or rational successfully silence what they exclude.
